    /// When the `tagValueType` field value is `ANY`, the `tagValues` field should be empty, which enforces overrides to the recommendation for resources with any tag values attached to them.

    /// For example, if the `tagKey` value is `B`, the `tagValueType` value is `ANY`, and the `tagValues` field is empty, overrides to the recommendation criteria occur for any resources that have the tag key B.
    /// If the `tagKey` value is `B`, the `tagValueType` value is `VALUE`, and the `tagValues` value is `s1`, overrides to the recommendation criteria only occur for resources that have the tag key B with the associated tag value s1.
