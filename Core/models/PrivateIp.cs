    /// A *private IP* is a conceptual term that refers to an IPv4 private IP address and related properties.
    /// The `privateIp` object is the API representation of a private IP.
    /// <br/>
    /// **Note:** For information about IPv6 addresses, see {@link Ipv6}.
    /// <br/>
    /// Each instance has a *primary private IP* that is automatically created and
    /// assigned to the primary VNIC during instance launch. If you add a secondary
    /// VNIC to the instance, it also automatically gets a primary private IP. You
    /// can't remove a primary private IP from its VNIC. The primary private IP is
    /// automatically deleted when the VNIC is terminated.
    /// <br/>
    /// You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
    /// information, see the `privateIp` operations and also
    /// [IP Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm).

    /// {@link #listPrivateIps(ListPrivateIpsRequest) listPrivateIps} and

    /// *primary* private IPs. To create and update primary private IPs, you instead
    /// work with instance and VNIC operations. For example, a primary private IP's

    /// {@link CreateVnicDetails} when calling either
    /// {@link #launchInstance(LaunchInstanceRequest) launchInstance} or
