    /// key and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128). It can be used to encrypt date columns only. 
    /// It requires a range of dates as input defined by the startDate and endDate attributes. The 
    /// start date must be less than or equal to the end date.
    /// <br/>
    /// The original column values in all the rows must be within the specified date range. The 
    /// encrypted values are also within the specified range. Therefore, to ensure uniqueness, the
    /// total number of dates in the range must be greater than or equal to the number of distinct 
    /// original values in the column. If an original value is not in the specified date range, it 
    /// might not produce a one-to-one mapping. All non-confirming values are mapped to a single 
    /// encrypted value, thereby producing a many-to-one mapping.
